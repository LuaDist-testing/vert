## Activating an environment

There isn't really any magic in Vert, and getting running in a virtual
environment using is a manual though simple process. After you build a virtual
env using vert, a shell script will be created in ./bin/activate of that vert.
To activate the vert execute:

    $> source ./bin/activate

All this script does is copy the current environment variables that setup your
paths (`PATH`, `LUA_CPATH`, `LUA_PATH` and `PS1`) and reassigning them to point
to the particular virtual env you're working on.

Once an environment is activate simple run `deactivate` to exit

    (vert)$> deactivate
